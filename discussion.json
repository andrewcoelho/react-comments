A UI is typically a combination of visual design (the look and feel) and the interaction design (how it works). UX, however, can encompass a wide range of disciplines, from industrial design to architecture to content.",

There are many more elements to user experience, such as information architecture -- how information is categorised and presented, usually to emphasise certain aspects or facilitate certain actions. There is also usability testing, which tests how easy to use and understand the application is. Then there's visual design, which deals with the look and feel. There are many other aspects to user experience because the user's experience is more than just what the user interacts with, it is anything and everything that you do to design the user's experience of your application.",

It depends on the project, though, as some SD projects are pretty much straight UX/CX projects.
